		<h1>Welcome to the beauty collage of Shenzhen</h1>
		<p>“In 2019, Shenzhen has been dubbed by The Guardian as "the world leader completing new skyscrapers.
			"The city is ranked the second in the world in terms of the number of 
			buildings above 150 meters, with 297 of them completed as of July 2021, 
			after neighboring Hong Kong.There were more skyscrapers completed in 
			Shenzhen in the year 2016 than in the whole of the US and Australia combined.” (Wikipedia
			Skyscraper construction started in Shenzhen in 1978, at a time when 
			the tallest building in the city was five stories tall. In the n
			ext decade, 300 high-rises were erected in the city,including 
			the Guomao Building. It was the city's first skyscraper and was 
			the tallest building in mainland China upon its opening in 1985.As Shenzhen's 
			highrise construction boom progressed into the 1990s, the skyscrapers erected 
			in the city became taller. In the decade spanning from 1996 to 2006, 18 
			buildings taller than 200 m (656 ft) were completed. The tallest of 
			these is the Diwang Building (Shun Hing Square), 
			the city's first building to exceed 300 m (984 ft) in height.
			</p>
        <p>This page is mainly for you to learn some more of this city's beauty.
			Most of Shenzhen's skyscrapers are concentrated in the Luohu, 
			Futian and Nanshan districts.Shenzhen's skyscraper boom is attributed to 
			its status as one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Come and take a look at these
			wonderful constructions and see how the city has grown over the years.
