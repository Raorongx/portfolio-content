		<h1>Introduction to Shenzhen's history</h1>
		  <p>Shenzhen is a city that has history that could be divided into four periods, the first one starting from prehistory to Ming dynasty, the second from Qing-era to 1940s, the third from 1950s to 1970s, and the last being the current history.</p>
      <p>Under each era, Shenzhen has embraced changes from different authorities and sometimes it is a city, sometimes it is under supervision of other districts.</p>
	<p>The name of Shenzhen first appeared in 1410 during the Ming Dynasty. Local people called the drains in paddy fields “zhen” or “chong”. The name “Shenzhen” means “deep drains”, because this is an area crisscrossed with rivers and streams, and there are deep drains in the paddy fields. Shenzhen became a township at the beginning of the Qing Dynasty.

		Shenzhen is also known as “Roc City.”</p>

	<p>During the Song Dynasty, Shenzhen became an important hub for maritime trade in South China. It was also famous for its salt and spices. In the Yuan Dynasty, pearls were another famous product of the area. In 1394 of the Ming Dynasty, Dongguan and Dapeng military bases were set up in the Shenzhen area.

		With a history going back more than 600 years, Nantou Ancient City was once a political center in the Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macao area in the Qing Dynasty.</p>
	
	<p>During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, Nantou was occupied by Japanese troops and so the county government temporarily moved to Dongguan County.

		In 1953, the Bao'an county seat moved eastward to Shenzhen Township, 10 kilometers from Nantou. As the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway ran through Shenzhen, more people lived there and industry and commerce prospered.</p>
	
	<p>In March 1979, the Central Government and Guangdong Provincial Government decided to rename Bao'an County Shenzhen City, to be governed under the administration of Huiyang Prefecture and Guangdong Province. In November that year, the city was promoted to prefecture level directly governed by the province. In August 1980, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) approved the establishment of a Special Economic Zone in Shenzhen. In March 1981, Shenzhen gained the status to be a vice-provincial city. In November 1988, the State Council approved Shenzhen, along with some other major cities in the country, to be listed as an independent entity of the province in the State Development Plan. It was given the rights of a provincial-level economic administration. In February 1992, the Shenzhen Municipal People's Congress, its Standing Committee and the Shenzhen Municipal Government were given the right to draft local laws and set local regulations by the Standing Committee of the NPC.

		By 2004, Shenzhen was completely urbanized, becoming a city without countryside.</p>
